# Floyd Warshall Algorithm - Recursive Approach

The purpose of this project is to write the Floyd Warshall algorithm in python using recursion.

## Project Details

As a starting point, a graph outlining a 4x4 matrix was provided along with an iterative version of the Floyd Warshall Algorithm. By way of background, the Floyd Warshall Algorithm calculates the shortest path between two nodes on a graph. As part of this project, additional tasks were required to be carried out, such as performing unit tests (to ensure that the functions work as they should) and performance tests to see the difference in time taken in executing the iterative version against the recursive version.
